# Express Rate Limiting for Authentication and Password Reset

This lesson demonstrates how to implement rate limiting for authentication and password reset endpoints in an Express application using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. Rate limiting is essential for protecting your application against brute-force attacks and ensuring that users cannot abuse the authentication or password reset processes.

## Setup

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install express express-rate-limit`.
2. In this directory, start the application with `node server.js`.

These settings help prevent abuse while allowing legitimate users to access the functionality they need.

## Usage

To test the rate limiting, you can simulate authentication and password reset requests using `curl`.

### Testing Authentication Rate Limiting

- To simulate an authentication attempt:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/auth
```

- After 10 attempts within 15 minutes, you should receive a message indicating that the rate limit has been exceeded.

### Testing Password Reset Rate Limiting

- To simulate a password reset attempt:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/reset-password
```

- After 5 attempts within an hour, you should receive a message indicating that the rate limit has been exceeded.

## Experiment

- Adjust the rate limiting settings in `server.js` to explore how different configurations impact the user experience and security.
- Consider implementing more sophisticated rate limiting strategies, such as dynamic rate limits based on user behavior or integrating with external rate limiting services.

This lesson provides a practical introduction to rate limiting in web applications, focusing on critical operations like authentication and password resets to enhance security and usability.
